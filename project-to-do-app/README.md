## Project To Do App

### The goal of this project is to practice working with Node.js, and learn how to write input to a file using fs, the built-in file system module of Node

We will use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and Express in this project.

**Basic functionality:**
We create a project with Node.js and Express and run the server with Nodemon. We want the user to be able to add a to do item and save this to a file. The user also has to be able to retrieve the item, to edit it or to delete it.

**Additional functionality:** the user can search for a to do item.
